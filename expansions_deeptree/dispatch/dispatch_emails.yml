      I have dispatched your ticket to a technician. They will review this and reach out with any comments, questions, or concerns when they can.

      To better facilitate this request, it would be best if we could set an appointment to work with them on this. Do you have a time that we could schedule to connect with the technician? If you could let me know when you are available, I will do my best to set an appointment around your schedule!

      If you do not want to work directly with the technician, do you have any deadlines for this request? If so, please let me know! That way, I can add this to the technician's worklist appropriately.

      Thank you for your time!
